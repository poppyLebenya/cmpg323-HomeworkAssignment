A repository that looks into the source code that changed my perspective on IT.

## Brief Description of the code
The code above is a code that calculates student marks, first years and seniors. 
So what the code does is it checks the students marks and sorts the accordingly.
It retrieves the students informayion form a file and writes it into an array after sorting it.
A user is ythen able to search through it.
